# obstacle-avoider

This project is done using arduino.Obstacle avoider uses a servo motor and ultrasonic senesor where the ultrasonic sensor.The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor which acts as the eyes of the obstacle avoider.The ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance between the obstacle avoider and the object infront of it.Then it compares the distances and chooses the best way to move.These obstacle avoiders are very useful in industries to carry the goods.
