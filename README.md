# obstacle-avoider

1] This project is done using arduino.
2] Obstacle avoider uses a servo motor and ultrasonic senesor where the ultrasonic sensor.
3] The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor which acts as the eyes of the obstacle avoider.
4] The ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance between the obstacle avoider and the object infront of it.
5] Then it compares the distances and chooses the best way to move.
6] These obstacle avoiders are very useful in industries to carry the goods.
