# Obstacle-Avoider

Obstacle avoider uses an Arduino, servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the shortest distance
path. The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor which acts as the eyes of the obstacle avoider. The ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance between the obstacle avoider and the objects in front of it. Then it compares the distances and chooses the best way to move. These obstacle avoiders are very useful in industries to carry the goods.
